# Feasibility and Risk Study

## System feasibility
### Similarities with existing systems

#### Courier IT
* Courier IT offers a professional service ensuring prompt response to calls for collections, prompt delivery of shipments and prompt reaction to queries.

* We are flexible in our ability to adapt to customer's requirements, be it collection or delivery times/places or billing procedures.

* The company is technologically advanced and offers a fully integrated and secure on-line system for transmitting text and data in a secure environment. It monitors the status of any consignment at every stage, from despatch to its ultimate delivery. This PC based system has been centrally developed to allow unlimited expansion in all areas and fields, to ensure their customers constantly receive information in the most modern methods. It is tailor-made and flexible and easily adapted to suit all customer requirements

#### Uber
- Ubers driver optimization is based on geolocation tracking, it allows a user to choose a pickup point at a certain time, when this time has elapsed, drivers are located and you are assigned a driver with the shortest relative distance and possibly a better-rated driver if you are a concurrent user.

## Economic feasibility
The current system in place at Phaki involves a large amount of human contribution to the process of planning routes for delivery. The long-term economic benefits of an automated route planning system will greatly outweigh both the initial investment needed to establish the system as well as the cost of maintaining it. The manual system that is currently in place incurs costs such as paying an employee to plan routes as well as money spent on excess petrol use due to unoptimized routes. There are also the costs involved in communicating canceled orders to drivers who then must improvise a route for delivering the remaining, uncancelled, packages. This leads to more petrol wastage and general confusion within the process as well as delays in the delivery process. Furthermore, a manual process also leads to overestimating or underestimating the number of drivers needed for day-to-day deliveries. When the number of drivers needed is overestimated, money is wasted on paying more drivers than necessary and when the number of drivers is underestimated then this leads to time delays. 

Our proposed solution, we found, will be feasible as it requires a relatively minimal initial investment to establish and has low maintenance costs.  The 4th industrial revolution has made access to web hosting services affordable and wide spread.  Monthly web hosting services on average cost around R250 to R500. Phaki would have to provide drivers with a smartphone provided they do not own one and the manager of the logistics operations as well as the consultant taking client orders must have access to a computer which Phaki already has. It is very clear that the average cost of this system is by far smaller than the costs and mistakes that the current system incurs and will save the company even more money in the future.


## Operational feasibility

We understand that although technology plays a big role in everyday life, not everyone is computer literate. Bearing this in mind we have decided to adopt a minimalistic approach to the design of the interfaces through which the end-user will interact with our system. A Phaki client currently places an order with Phaki via a telephone call to a consultant. This method will be kept in place in order to keep our system as familiar as possible. The difference, however, will be that a consultant will now be able to log a client's order directly to our system via an easy-to-use website. Our basic website interface will also cater to the manager of the logistics operations for the purpose of monitoring orders as well as managing the fleet owned by Phaki and the drivers employed by Phaki. The app through which the driver will receive delivery instructions will also be kept minimal and simple to make the transition to this new system as smooth as possible. In conclusion we will be keeping the complexities of the system within our API while maintaining an easy-to-use and minimal interface that will allow our end-users to take full advantage of these complexities.

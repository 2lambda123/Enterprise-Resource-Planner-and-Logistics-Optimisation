## Prioritised Use Cases

Taking into account the core of our project, which is to automate the process of generating routes for delivering packages to their respective 
locations on time, we have prioritized the following use cases in their relevant subsystems.

Manager subsystem:
- Register a new driver.
- Update truck information.
- Update driver information.
- View route used by every driver. 

Driver subsystem:
- View orders for the day.
- View route for the day.

Phaki Service subsystem
- Calculate Optimized number of trucks required.
- Calculate Optimized route for each truck.
- Store routes for retrieval by relevant user.

## Problem Statement

Delivery logistics company Phaki has to execute manual instructions to multiple locations from a branch. The current point of action of their drivers is to plan a route for all their destinations received by dispatch. Each day these orders must be prepared and processed for the drivers at dispatch, where packages are loaded onto the vehicles. Furthermore, drivers are given destinations with no analysis on the locations and therefore no great insight on their route, when the route is set they depart to delivery destinations. Once a driver delivers a package to a client, the company is unaware if the package has been delivered until the driver completes his route. That is the time problem Phaki faces daily, the real-time delay of processes.


## Proposed solution

Standardize logistical delivery times by automating a planned schedule - (developed by mapping each delivery location received from the consultant who placed the customers order). The automated planned schedule will prevent systematical delays in real-time by replacing manual inefficiencies.
